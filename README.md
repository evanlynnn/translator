# Edge Addons Hackathon -- Translator

As non-native English speakers, we sometimes come across unknown words or sentences when navigating web pages. Most of time, we open up a new tab and google for the meaning. We may get tiresome if we repeat such process many times. What will our life be if we can look up the meaning of words or sentences without switching tabs?

Thus, we delevop this addon -- **Translator**. Users can translate their selected words or sentences into different languages. It uses Azure Translator to finish this task.
